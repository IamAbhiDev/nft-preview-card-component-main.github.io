### What I learned

Completing the NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor provided a valuable opportunity to refresh my CSS skills. While the challenge was centered around a basic and static HTML-CSS layout with or without responsive design, I was able to reinforce my ability to style elements using CSS properties effectively. I refreshed my understanding of concepts such as selectors, positioning, and the box model. Additionally, I practiced using version control with Git to track my changes throughout the project. This challenge was an excellent way to solidify my foundational CSS knowledge.Completing the QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor provided a valuable opportunity to refresh my CSS skills.

### Continued development

In the future, I'm looking forward to exploring advanced CSS techniques, including responsive design and animations. I also plan to incorporate JavaScript to enhance user interactions and add dynamic elements to my projects. This challenge has inspired me to continue developing my skills and creating more engaging web experiences.
